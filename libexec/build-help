## usage
# Simply display the builder usage.  Though it would be nice if some of this
# information was pushed down into the sub-commands.
cat<<EOF
Options
-------
 -v, --version	Display the builder version.
 -d, --debug	Enable debug logging.
 -h, --help	Display the builder help and exit (may appear anywhere on the
		command line).

Commands
--------
  query		The query is used internally by builder, while allowing
		one to query various packages from the builder repository.

  source	Create a copy/checkout of the package sources inside of
		packages/<category>/<name>/source.  The source/ directory
		within a package takes precendences over the SOURCE_URI,
		allowing in-place development of various packages.  This is
		particularly useful if the SOURCE_URI is an SCM.

  fetch		Fetch the sources for a package from the SOURCE_URI and store
		them into the sources/ top-level directory.  This is done
		automatically for all commands which depend on it.

  package	Prep, compile and construct a binary "artifact" file for a
		given package.  This command is performed automatically for all
		commands which depend on it.

  install	Install a binary artifact into the sysroot. This action is
		performed automatically for any packages which the current
		target depends on.  If necessary produce binary artifacts for
		all package deps.

  clean		Clean specified package from sysroot and artifacts.

  distclean	Clean up specified package from sysroot, artifacts, and sources.

  export	Export the binary package to an rpm.

  help		Display this help. Try 'help --all' to list all commands'.
